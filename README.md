4.1 
I defined a bool function called arrayContains that takes arguments 
in the form of an entered number (testnum) and an array of numbers, 
and compares them against each other, one by one.
I then defined the array and scanf-ed for the number inside of the main function, 
and called the arrayContains function.

4.2
Defined a function called removeLastCharacter by used a while loop 
to find "\0" in the string and then go back one and change that character to "\0", 
thus removing the last character.
I opened a file and defined an array. 
I intialized the array to all 0s and then used fgets to put the characters from 
the textfile into the array. Then printed the array. Then I called the 
removeLastCharacter function on the array and printed it again.

4.3
Opened a file, defined an array asciiValue, then intialized it. 
used a while loop to set j as the variable that all of the characters pass through, 
and everytime a character passes through, its index in asciiValue gets incremented. 
Printed out the result
